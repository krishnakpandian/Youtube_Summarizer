# Youtube_Summarizer
This program takes in youtube video links and returns summaries of those videos.

This was an interesting project that doesn't work as amazingly as I thought. First thing is that youtube auto generated captions are not that great and will cause issues for your summarizer. Secondly not all videos have access to the xml which is really odd for some reason. I have no idea why this is the case but they don't. Also summarize_bot API was not as effective as I thought but that could be do the captions being strange.

I had so much hope for this project but there are so many weird nuances that I am just going to leave this here for someone else to play around with.
